    <h1>How you communicate with AI</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In this day and age, many people use AI for school, work, creative endeavors, and research.
         Despite its widespread use, <br>many people don't know how they actually talk to the AI.
         In this article, we explore how your prompt is seen by the AI for<br> it to respond to you.

    <h2>Request to talk to AI</h2>
    <p>This process starts and ends with the user's input. First, you type your prompt for the AI and hit send.</p>

    <h2>TCP</h2>
    <p>When you send your prompt for the AI, the text data is converted into binary code, bits and bytes. 
        If the binary is too<br> much to send in one piece, then the data is separated into <u>packets</u>, which are groups of data,
    by the <u>TCP</u> or Transmission <br>Control Protocol.</p>

    <h2>Internet Protocol</h2>
    <p>After your request is broken down by the TCP, two <u>IP addresses</u> are added to it. First, your IP address, so it knows 
        where <br>to go back to. Secondly, the destintion IP address, which is the AI's servers.

    <h2>Router</h2>
    <p>Now that your packets have been properly labeled, the Router finds the most <u>heuristic</u>,<br> or efficient, path to
     get to the destination. Once that has been determined, it sends the packets on their way.</p>

    <h2>The Data Center</h2>
    <p>The packets arrive at the AI's data center and are reassembled, forming your prompt. The AI processes it and makes a response.</p>

    <h2>The Return</h2>
    <p>The AI's response is broken down to packets and sent back to you.</p>

    <h2>Reciever TCP</h2>
    <p>The TCP reassembles the broken down packets and checks for errors that may have happened between the transfer.</p>

    <h2>The Final Destination</h2>
    <p>After all the steps are followed, the user is greeted with the response from the AI.</p>
